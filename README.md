# my dotfiles??
* I currently use KDE Plasma on Arch Linux btw.
* I use Vim for all text editing, including coding or programming.
* I use the mpv media player for all media playing despite KDE Plasma installing VLC for some dependency.
* The Foot termianl and Sway configurations in this repo are not really used nor updated anymore, because I don't use those things anymore.
* Yes, I do love CLI!
